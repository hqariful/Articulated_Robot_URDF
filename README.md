# What this is about

Creating an urdf file from scratch is time consuming and prone to error. Here I made a CAD file of an articulated robot then converted it into urdf file with a converter [fusion2urdf-ros2](https://github.com/dheena2k2/fusion2urdf-ros2).
With this we can drastically save time and energy in building robot.
